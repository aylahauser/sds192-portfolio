We can use leaflet to make some fancier maps.


```{r}
#install.packages(leaflet)
library(leaflet)
```


[Manual here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/leaflet.pdf) [Here is a text on leaflet.](https://bookdown.org/nicohahn/making_maps_with_r5/docs/leaflet.html)


```{r}
leaflet()|>
  addTiles()
?leaflet()
```


Let's put Smith College on the map. [Here's the lat and long.](https://www.google.com/search?q=smith+college+latitude+and+longitude&client=firefox-b-1-lm&sca_esv=e89764eee12a19ad&ei=ibXQZuWTDJf8ptQP-6iyqQw&oq=smith+college+latitude+and+long&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiH3NtaXRoIGNvbGxlZ2UgbGF0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIGxvbmcqAggAMggQIRigARjDBDIIECEYoAEYwwRI9ylQ_RhY2R5wA3gBkAEAmAGeAaABkAWqAQMwLjW4AQHIAQD4AQGYAgigAsUFwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICChAhGKABGMMEGArCAgQQIRgKmAMAiAYBkAYIkgcDMy41oAfwFg&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)


```{r}
leaflet()|>
  addTiles() |>
  addMarkers(lng = 72.6403,
             lat = 42.3163,
             popup = "Home of the Pioneers",
             label = "Smith College")
```


Whooops. We need a negative sign to indicate west.


```{r}
leaflet()|>
  addTiles() |>
  addMarkers(lng = -72.6403,
             lat = 42.3163,
             popup = "Home of the Pioneers",
             label = "Smith College")
  
  


```

```{r}
#we made regular markers for smith and hometown, then added awesome markers to get the school and home icons. 
home_icon <- awesomeIcons()
school_icon <- awesomeIcons(icon = "education")

#this is the code that makes the two markers with awesome icons on the map. Remember to use pipe and commas. 
leaflet()|>
  addTiles() |>
  addAwesomeMarkers(lng = -83.9207,
             lat = 35.9606, 
             popup = "My Home",
             label = "Knoxville",
             icon = home_icon
             ) |>
 addAwesomeMarkers(lng = -72.6403,
             lat = 42.3163,
             popup = "Home of the Pioneers",
             label = "Smith College", 
             icon = school_icon
             ) 
    
            
```


You try:

1.  Put your home city and Smith College on the same map.

2.  Use `awesomeIcons()` to make your home look like a home and smith look like a college.

    i.  You will first need to save the icon an object. (Maybe the home is called home).

        Hint: Use icon "education", "book", "sleeping" for the college icon.

    ii. Then you will need to use `addAwesomeMarkers()`.

3.  Finally add this webpage to your index.qmd and make sure it renders correctly.
